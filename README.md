# SHChallenge
Repo for a challenge 2021.

Only the readme has been editied post 6 hours

Ran out of time to do everything.

Features yet to implement:
1. Proper exporting and importing of files (Escape button should show save/load, no system dialogue/similar)
2. Possibly camera movement (movement of the actual camera, currently only rotation of camera works)
3. Decimal remainders
4. Hit markers
5. Removal of projectiles on reset (workaround, wait 2 seconds after firing) 
6. Refactoring
7. Testing different resolutions
8. Test Cases (Especially cases 64, 1000 etc. double ^1/3 might have casued a glitch leading to x.99999, which when cast to int, lost data. No time to fix)
9. Better camera positioning
10. Left feature- Clicking on a new operation, should update the operation. Workaround is to press 'z' and put in a new operation.
