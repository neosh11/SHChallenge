# SHChallenge
Repo for a challenge 2021.

Ran out of time to do everything.

Features yet to implement:
1. Proper exporting and importing of files
2. Possibly camera movement
3. Decimal remainders
4. Hit markers
5. Removal of projectiles on reset
6. Refactoring
7. Testing different resolutions
8. Test Cases
9. Better camera positioning
10. Left feature- Clicking on a new operation, should update the operation. Workaround is to press 'z' and put in a new operation.
